    "1. Who collected the InsideAirbnb data? (2 points) \n",
    "\n",
    "The InsideAirbnb was collected by Murray Cox, Tom Slee, and a team of collaborators. Murray Cox is an Australian community artist, activist and photo- journalist who \\\"uses data, media, and technology for social change\\\" (Inside Airbnb). Cox is supported by a team of data journalists, housing activists, and artists working towards the empowerment of communities through data to understand, decide and control the role of renting residential homes to tourists. (Inside Airbnb).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why did they collect the InsideAirbnb data? (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Murray Cox and Tom Slee collected the InsideAirbnb data to critically assess the impact of Airbnb on housing markets, to provide independent publicly available data, and to facilitate the improved understanding of city authorities and regulatory bodies. Motivated by an observation of increasing entire-home listings and \\\"multi-lister\\\" hosts, Cox and Slee aimed to challenge Airbnb’s portrayal as a platform for casual home sharing, revealing that much of its revenue comes from commercial operators who are squeezing housing supply, raising rents, and pushing long-term residents out (Bloomberg 2019). Cox and Slee sought to understand how Airbnb affects housing affordability and availability, particularly in cities like New York, by analysing the prevalence of \\\"multi-lister hosts\\\"—individuals or companies managing multiple listings—which contributes to housing challenges, economic, and racial inequalities. By creating independent datasets, they also sought to address the limitations of relying on Airbnb's selective and potentially biased data releases, equipping researchers, journalists, policymakers, and housing advocates with reliable information to evaluate Airbnb's impact and advocate for better regulation.\n",

    "NOTE!!! \n",
    "Remaining 2 points from Q2 will probably come from a graph. Possibly a general graph reading data from all days of InsideAirbnb and showing the anomalies. \n",
